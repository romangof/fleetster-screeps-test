# Screeps Game

Fun real coding game  
This started as my coding challenge when joining fleetster but is now more of a hobby.  


* Screeps supports most ES6 functionality, but import/export is not allowed
* The constants are in the `lib` folder and are used in the eslint file, but the game server has them, no need to import them
